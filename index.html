										<h2 class="major">Personal Infomation</h2>
										<p>Hello! My name is Sarah Khan (s3897667), im from Melbourne in Victoria Australia. I was born in the United States and had my early childhood spent in Tokyo Japan. Im Pakistani and Muslim and speak fluent Urdu, (I did learn a bit of Japanese, but have forgotten over the years), I spend most of my time playing video games like Genshin Impact and experimenting around with software’s such as Adobe After Effects., and I also try to consume quite a lot of media (films, anime, manga).</p>

										<h2 class="major">Interest In IT</h2>
										<p>Information Technology itself is such a broad field filled with great innovative systems. My interest in IT started way back in high school, I had always had a interest in video and photo editing. I would spend hours on different projects making and compiling random things, now I grown to working with adobe after effects and sometimes work with 3d objects, shape layers and more. </p>
										<p>I chose to study at RMIT mainly from personal feedback I had gotten from my career advisors in high school, through networking and attending career counselling sessions where students from RMIT came with information on their courses. RMIT is also convince-wise a great place to be! I use to attend the ATARNOTES lectures that were held in building 80 and had found the campus and people around me just a great place to be in.</p>
										<p>From my time here at RMIT I hope to be able to gain knowledge of this fast-growing industry of future thinking in the hopes of going out into the world and gaining a stable job for my future. I want to know more about fields such as cloud computing, gaming and cyber security as these peaks my interests.</p>
