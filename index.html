										<h2 style="color:LightBlue;">Interest In IT</h2>
										<p>Information Technology itself is such a broad field filled with great innovative systems. My interest in IT started way back in high school, I had always had a interest in video and photo editing. I would spend hours on different projects making and compiling random things, now I grown to working with adobe after effects and sometimes work with 3d objects, shape layers and more. </p>
										<p>I chose to study at RMIT mainly from personal feedback I had gotten from my career advisors in high school, through networking and attending career counselling sessions where students from RMIT came with information on their courses. RMIT is also convince-wise a great place to be! I use to attend the ATARNOTES lectures that were held in building 80 and had found the campus and people around me just a great place to be in.</p>
										<p>From my time here at RMIT I hope to be able to gain knowledge of this fast-growing industry of future thinking in the hopes of going out into the world and gaining a stable job for my future. I want to know more about fields such as cloud computing, gaming and cyber security as these peaks my interests.</p>

									<h2 class="major">IT Project</h2>
									<h3 style="color:BurlyWood;">Overview</h3>
									<p>Ever wanted to keep track with everything that is going in with your life in a clean and organized manner? Ever wanted to make a notion page but found the UI too complex and complicated to understand, well how about something more minimalist and simpler, through our fact paced digital world it is hard to keep track of what tasks we need to get done, but with the help of this smartphone application, users will be able to track the progression of tasks as well as implement note taking so they are able to place their content into one specific application. As well as a reward system </p>
									<h3 style="color:BurlyWood;">Motivation</h3>
									<p>Recent studies have found that ‘despite time tracking apps, hints, and tips being available, only 17% of people track their time.’ Leading to poorer outcomes and less value. Using MIT App Inventor, would allow servers to store the application and help develop it. Time management is doing the right things in both an effective and productive manner. Targeting both Android and IOS systems, this application can help improve work efficiency. Enforcing an application is both tidy, minimalist and clean can draw in more users, in the aim to help boost productivity, enabling us all to better utilize our time for ourselves and our well-being.</p>
									<h3 style="color:BurlyWood;">Description</h3>
									<p>This application will be able to operate on both IOS and Android systems, as well as desktop for a more bigger view  which would open up the app page, a page welcome the user with their character icon starts up, which then fades into the homepage consisting of a basic calendar on the at the bottom and an input dialogue box underneath where tasks can be inserted and tracked according to progress (a progress bar visually indicating how many tasks have been completed), as well as the tasks for the day. This application will also have a dark mode!!!
<br>The hamburger icon on the top left opens up the panel with the headings My Activity, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, and Garden, each open up to a particular section of the app. The My Activity panel is what opens up when you enter the app, it is basically the homepage of the application that consists of the user’s icon on the top right and then all the components stated above.
<br>The Calendar section of the application is a full-page calendar that can be rotated sideways to give a whole month preview to the user. Toggle switches as the top can slide from left to right to showcase the events the user has tagged under the 3 main categories the app has which are ‘important, appointments, and events. Similar to the outlook calendar interface, this applications calendar can be set to a week which then displays the weeks upcoming tasks or events underneath, color coordinating them according to the right category. You can also import calendars using links
<br>The ‘Tasks’ section of the application is just a listed format of tasks the user wants done, it is an extended format from the home-page where you are able to see more tasks that can be defined into categories such as ‘work, home, personal and study’
<br>The ‘Notes’ section of the application allows the user to take notes as one would on a word document, once you finish with the document it minimizes into a gallery of tiles with other notes the user may have., it is best place to write out notes, sketches, attach images and web links.
To make the app more enjoyable, when the user completes a specific number of set tasks (their potential set goal) a corresponding plant would grow, in the end the user is left with a garden to reward themselves for their progress. </p>
                   <h3 style="color:BurlyWood;">Tools & Technologies</h3>
									 <p>This project will start off with components like finding the color scheme, mockup designs or prototyping tools like protopie or framer x , the app design as well as a software tools to create the application on, which can include MIT App Inventor, Appy Pie AppMakr, Swift and Xcode.</p>
									 <h3 style="color:BurlyWood;">Skills Required</h3>
									 <p>You will need to be able to know a powerful programming language like Swift or Python depending on how you want to be creating the application unless you were use a no code program like appypie. To be able to find these skills can be easy, it would be great if creator has some experience in programming, or they can take a short course to grasp the basics as well as seek professional advice as this is a very broad field and people with experience can be easily found.</p>
 								 	 <h3 style="color:BurlyWood;">Outcome</h3>
									 <p>If this project was to become successful, this would improve productivity for those who struggle to manage their time wisely, improving output as well teaching people to leave time out for their selves. Allowing users to break down tasks down into simpler items making larger projects less hectic. With this application, the user’s to-do list will become easier to manage giving you satisfaction as you cross the days tasks as well as track tasks on hand and reach those assignment deadlines beforehand!</p>
